# Error codes

Every error the backend returns has a stable dotted `code`. On HTTP it is an RFC 9457 `application/problem+json` body:

```json
{ "type": "about:blank", "title": "Not Found", "status": 404, "detail": "Vault not found.", "code": "vault.not_found", "trace_id": "0af7651916cd43dd8448eb211c80319c" }
```

The same `trace_id` is in the `x-trace-id` response header on every response. Tool errors (REST `/api/tools/*` and MCP `tools/call`) are `{ "error", "code", "trace_id" }` values, and MCP protocol errors carry `{ "code", "trace_id" }` in the JSON-RPC error `data`. The browser sends a W3C `traceparent` header and the backend continues that trace.

Raw database or upstream text is never in a response. It is only on the request span (field `source`), found by `trace_id`.

The `ErrorCode` enum is in `backend/src/error.rs`. A unit test fails if a code is missing from this file, so add a row here when you add a variant.

| Code | HTTP | Meaning | Emitted by |
|------|------|---------|------------|
| `auth.unauthorized` | 401 | No valid session cookie or API token, or wrong email or password. | `auth.rs` (extractor), `routers/auth.rs`, `routers/mcp.rs` |
| `auth.forbidden` | 403 | Request rejected before auth, for example a disallowed browser `Origin` on `/mcp`, or a non-admin reading `/api/debug/capsules/{trace_id}`. | `routers/mcp.rs`, `routers/debug.rs` |
| `auth.email_taken` | 409 | Signup with an email that already has an account. | `models_user.rs`, `routers/auth.rs` |
| `auth.not_found` | 404 | API token or session id does not exist or is not yours. | `routers/auth.rs` |
| `auth.scope` | 403 | The token lacks the scope this route or tool needs, or is restricted to another vault, or the route is account-level and the token is vault-restricted. | `gate.rs`, `authz.rs`, `tools/registry.rs` |
| `auth.token_expired` | 401 | The API token's `expires_at` has passed. Create a new token. | `gate.rs`, `auth.rs` |
| `auth.session_expired` | 401 | The session cookie is past its (sliding) expiry or its JWT `exp`. Log in again. | `gate.rs`, `auth.rs` |
| `rate.limited` | 429 | Too many requests for this user, token or (for login and signup) client address. Honour the `Retry-After` header. | `gate.rs` |
| `tenant.denied` | 403 | The database refused a query on permissions grounds. Logged at error level; treat as a high-severity alert. | `error.rs` (DB error mapping) |
| `vault.not_found` | 404 | Vault id is malformed or unknown. | `routers/vaults.rs` |
| `vault.forbidden` | 403 | You are not a member, or not an owner, of the vault (or of both entities' vaults). Also the default for a bare 403. | `vaults/service.rs`, `entities/service.rs` |
| `entity.not_found` | 404 | Entity id unknown or not visible to you. | `routers/entities.rs`, `tools/registry.rs` |
| `memory.not_found` | 404 | Memory id unknown or not visible to you. | `routers/entities.rs`, `tools/registry.rs` |
| `chat.thread_not_found` | 404 | Chat thread id unknown or not yours. | `routers/chat.rs` |
| `connector.not_found` | 404 | Unknown connector kind. | `routers/connectors.rs` |
| `connector.not_connected` | 400 | The action needs a connector that has not been connected. | `routers/connectors.rs` |
| `source.not_found` | 404 | Unknown source key. | `routers/sources.rs`, `sources/registry.rs` |
| `tool.not_found` | 404 | Unknown tool name (REST, MCP and registry). | `routers/tools.rs`, `routers/mcp.rs`, `tools/registry.rs` |
| `resource.not_found` | 404 | Generic not found, also the default for a bare 404. | `error.rs`, `routers/entities.rs` (bad id), various |
| `validation.invalid` | 400 | The request or tool arguments are invalid. Also the default for a bare 400, for MCP protocol errors and for tool errors with no more specific code. | most routers, `tools/registry.rs`, `routers/mcp.rs` |
| `db.conflict` | 409 | A transaction conflicted with another write. Retryable: repeat the request. Also the default for a bare 409. | `error.rs` (DB error mapping) |
| `db.duplicate` | 409 | A unique index rejected the write. Not retryable. | `error.rs` (DB error mapping), `routers/auth.rs` |
| `job.no_handler` | n/a | A job of a kind no handler is registered for was claimed. Dead-lettered, never sent over HTTP (stored in `job.last_error_code`). | `jobs/worker.rs` |
| `job.lease_expired` | n/a | A job was claimed `max_attempts` times and each lease expired (worker crash loop). Dead-lettered. Stored in `job.last_error_code`. | `jobs/leader.rs` |
| `job.panicked` | n/a | A job handler panicked. Retried with backoff, dead after `max_attempts`. Stored in `job.last_error_code`. | `jobs/worker.rs` |
| `internal` | 500 | Anything else. The detail is always the generic "Internal server error."; use the `trace_id` to find the cause. | everywhere via `AppError::internal` and unmapped DB errors |
