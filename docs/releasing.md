# Releasing

## SurrealDB 3: no release order to keep

"Update now" runs the updater script that is already loaded from the OLD release (`scripts/auto-update.sh` is read into memory before it checks out the new tag), and all an old updater does with the new tag is `docker compose pull` and `docker compose up -d`. So a release that pins SurrealDB 3.x must move 2.x data at `docker compose up` itself. 2.0 does: the one-shot `surreal-upgrade` service (`scripts/surreal-upgrade-service.sh`), which `surrealdb` waits for (`condition: service_completed_successfully`), runs `scripts/upgrade-surreal-v3.sh` when an install has a 2.x volume and no recorded move (see [upgrading-to-surrealdb-3.md](upgrading-to-surrealdb-3.md)). Installs on any 1.x release can therefore take 2.0 directly.

The bridge release 1.4.2 (the updater hook plus the backup service, still pinning `surrealdb/surrealdb:v2.3`) is recommended, not required: its updater runs the move before it restarts anything and puts the old release back if the move fails, which the `surreal-upgrade` path cannot (by the time it runs, `up` has already replaced the old containers, so a failed move leaves the app down until `docker compose up -d` is run again).

Keep both when changing either: the compose service and the updater hook run the same script, and whichever runs first records `SURREAL_DATA_VOLUME` in `.env` so the other does nothing.

## Cutting the bridge release

Versions: this `foundation` line is `2.0.0` (SurrealDB 3 and a database per org, a breaking self-host upgrade). The bridge is cut from `v1.4.1` (the last 1.x release) and is versioned `1.4.2`: bump `backend/Cargo.toml`, `backend/Cargo.lock` and `frontend/package.json` on the bridge branch, so the updater sees 1.4.1 < 1.4.2 < 2.0.0.

`foundation` cannot be the bridge: its backend uses SurrealDB SDK 3.x (`backend/Cargo.toml`), which refuses any 2.x server, so a tag from `foundation` with the compose pin flipped back to 2.x crash-loops every install. The bridge is the latest v1.x tag plus only the files below, taken from `foundation`:

| File | Why |
|---|---|
| `scripts/upgrade-surreal-v3.sh` | the hook (new file) |
| `scripts/auto-update.sh` | do not copy the whole file: keep the v1 one and add the hook block (the `new_major`/`old_major` check that calls `upgrade-surreal-v3.sh`), the `BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` generation, and `docker compose pull backend frontend backup`. Its `ENCRYPTION_KEY_LEGACY_EMPTY` and `JWT_SECRET` blocks need the 3.x backend, leave them out |
| `backend/scripts/backup/Dockerfile`, `backend/scripts/backup/eunomia-backup.sh` | the hook takes its pre-upgrade backup with the NEW compose file's `backup` image and `SURREAL_BIN`; v1.x has no such image. On the bridge the Dockerfile takes the CLI from `surrealdb/surrealdb:v2.3` (its nightly backups run against the 2.x server, which a 3.x CLI cannot talk to), and its restore lets the field definitions a 2.x export repeats overwrite, so a 2.x dump re-imports |
| `docker-compose.yml` | only add the `backup` service and the `eunomia-backups` volume (copy those two blocks); keep the `surrealdb/surrealdb:v2.x` pin and everything else as in the v1 tag |
| `.github/workflows/release.yml` | build and publish the `backup` image (matrix `image: [backend, frontend, backup]`, context `./backend/scripts/backup`) |
| `scripts/tests/auto-update.test.sh`, `scripts/tests/backup.test.sh`, `scripts/tests/upgrade-surreal-v3*.test.sh` | optional, keeps the bridge testable |

```sh
git switch -c release/bridge "$(git tag -l 'v1.*' | sort -V | tail -1)"
git checkout foundation -- scripts/upgrade-surreal-v3.sh backend/scripts/backup
git checkout foundation -- .github/workflows/release.yml   # then diff it against the v1 one
# hand-merge: scripts/auto-update.sh and docker-compose.yml as described in the table
bash scripts/tests/auto-update.test.sh && bash scripts/tests/backup.test.sh
bash scripts/ci/check-release-order.sh <bridge tag>        # "does not pin SurrealDB 3.x" is expected
git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin release/bridge vX.Y.Z
```

The 3.x release is cut from `foundation`. It no longer has to wait for the bridge (see above).

## Enforcement

`scripts/ci/check-release-order.sh <tag>` exits 1 when `<tag>` pins 3.x and 2.x data could reach the 3.x server: the tag's compose file lacks the `surreal-upgrade` service that `surrealdb` waits for (with `scripts/surreal-upgrade-service.sh`), AND the previous `v*` tag lacks the updater hook (`scripts/upgrade-surreal-v3.sh` and the call to it in `scripts/auto-update.sh`). It also exits 1 when the compose pin and the `surrealdb` SDK major in `backend/Cargo.toml` at that tag disagree (a 2.x pin over a 3.x backend, or the reverse), which is what a bridge cut from `foundation` would be. Run it before tagging, and as the first step of `.github/workflows/release.yml` (needs `fetch-depth: 0`):

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with: { ref: "${{ env.TAG }}", fetch-depth: 0 }
- run: bash scripts/ci/check-release-order.sh "$TAG"
```

Test: `bash scripts/tests/check-release-order.test.sh`.
